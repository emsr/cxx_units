	The Units of Measure Library
	Copyright (C) 2001  Keith Nicewarner

The units library consists of classes and utilities for representing
and manipulating measurements.  There are three class categories in
the units library: scalar, 2D vector, and 3D vector.  These groups
represent 1, 2, and 3 dimensional measurements, respectively.  By
providing these classes, it is hoped that application developers can
be relieved of the burden of internal units representation.  The
classes allow the C++ compiler to use typing information to check for
unit mismatch errors instead of waiting until run-time for the errors
to pop up.  This frees the application developer to focus safely on
the problem at hand and less on the details of how units are
represented.
