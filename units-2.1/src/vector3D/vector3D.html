<h1>User Guide for <a href="../units.html">units</a>::vector3D Class Library</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This class library builds on the 
<a href="../scalar/scalar.html">scalar</a> classes.
It extends some of the scalar units of measure into 3 dimensions.
A 3D vector in this library has an x, y, and z component in cartesian space.  
No reference frame is assumed for the vector.  The application 
is responsible for determining the reference frame, context,
and validity of any vector.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Construction</h2>

<h3><a href="Vector3D.h">Vector3D</a></h3>

<p>
The most basic 3D vector class is the Vector3D template class.  This
gives the full set of 3D vector operations and ignores the type of
the template argument, as long as it has arithmetic operators defined.
For example:
<code><pre>
      Vector3D< int >    ivec(1, 2, 3);
      Vector3D< double > dvec(1.2, 3.4, 5.6);
      Vector3D< char >   cvec('a', 'b', 'c');  // strange but legal
</pre></code>
The components can be accessed or changed using the public data 
members <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>:
<code><pre>
      dvec.x = 2.1;
      dvec.y = 2 * dvec.x;
      dvec.z = dvec.x + dvec.y;
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
A Vector3D does not have explicit units associated with it and is
therefore as dangerous as using a <code>double</code> with implicit
units.  The Vector3D template class was provided as a convenience for
low-level vector algebra applications.
</p>

<h3><a href="Unit3D.h">Unit3D</a></h3>

<p>
To construct a 3D vector with units associated with it, use the Unit3D 
template class.  For example:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > lvec(MetersLength(1), MetersLength(2), MetersLength(3));
      Unit3D< Speed >  svec(KnotsSpeed(100), KnotsSpeed(200), KnotsSpeed(300));
</pre></code>
The components can be accessed or changed using the public member 
<b>functions</b> <code>x()</code>, <code>y()</code>, and <code>z()</code>:
<code><pre>
      lvec.x() = MetersLength(2.1);
      lvec.y() = 2 * lvec.x();
      lvec.z() = lvec.x() + lvec.y();
</pre></code>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Comparison</h2>

<p>
Testing for equality can be done in two ways: binary and similar.
Binary equality is the same as testing <code>double == double</code>.
This is potentially dangerous because it compares the binary images
of the two numbers, not their values.  The slightest variation can
lead to an inequality.  It's up to the application to decide if this
is the desired behavior.
</p>

<p>
More often, the application will wish to test if two vectors are
"close enough" to each other.  This can be done with the 
<code>similar</code> function provided with all vector template classes.
The default tolerance for the <code>Unit3D</code> template class is the 
default tolerance for the base unit (the template argument).  There is no
default tolerance for the <code>Vector3D</code> template class; the 
application must always provide a tolerance.  The tolerance is used
to test if one vector is within a cube around the other vector.
The side of the cube is 2 times the tolerance.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
Once constructed, a 3D vector can be manipulated using linear algebra
operators.  The application developer should look at 
<a href="Vector3D.h">Vector3D.h</a> or
<a href="Unit3D.h">Unit3D.h</a>
to see the full list of valid operators.  Some examples are:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > a(MetersLength(1), MetersLength(2), MetersLength(3));

      Unit3D< Length > b = 2 * a / 3.4;

      b += a;

      Unit3D< Length > c = (a - 3 * b);
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
The <code>Vector3D</code> and <code>Unit3D</code> template classes
share all arithmetic operators, with the exception that <code>Unit3D</code>
does not have a public dot product or cross product operator because the units
for these products are squared.  Since <code>Vector3D</code> has no units,
the products are available:
<code><pre>
      Vector3D< double > a(1.1, 2.2, 3.3);
      Vector3D< double > b(3.3, 2.2, 1.1);

      double             dot   = a * b;  // dot product
      Vector3D< double > cross = a % b;  // cross product
</pre></code>
Remember that in 3D, the cross product is a vector; in 2D, it's
a scalar.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>
The application developer should look at
<a href="Vector3D.h">Vector3D.h</a> or
<a href="Unit3D.h">Unit3D.h</a>
to see the full list of valid functions.  The functions
are shared by both <code>Vector3D</code> and <code>Unit3D</code>
and are fairly straight forward.  The distance functions may be
a little counter-intuitive for unit vectors other than 
<code>Unit3D< Length ></code>, but they represent a mathematically
useful concept.  For instance:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Speed > a(KnotsSpeed(20), KnotsSpeed(-20), KnotsSpeed(2));
      Unit3D< Speed > b(KnotsSpeed(22), KnotsSpeed(-15), KnotsSpeed(1));

      Speed c = distance(a, b);
</pre></code>
In this case, <code>c</code> can be interpreted as the magnitude of
the "error" between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, with the
appropriate units.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Cross-Unit Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
Some <code>Unit3D</code> classes have arithmetic operators defined so 
that they can interact with other units.  These interactions are the common
relationships between units:
</p>

<center><table>
<tr><td>Unit3D< Speed >        </td><td> = Unit3D< Length > </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unit3D< Acceleration > </td><td> = Unit3D< Speed >  </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unit3D< Force >        </td><td> = Mass           </td><td> * Unit3D< Acceleration ></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
These relationships can be rearranged to suit the application.  For 
instance:
<code><pre>
      // Compute velocity.
      Unit3D< Speed > velocity = Unit3D< Length >(MetersLength(5),
                                                  MetersLength(7),
                                                  MetersLength(9)) / SecondsTime(2);

      // Compute position after a duration.
      Unit3D< Length > position = velocity * SecondsTime(10); 
</pre></code>
Note that there is no operator to divide a vector by another vector.
If we wanted to compute the time to travel to a position given a
velocity, we'd have to assume that the velocity is in the same
direction as the position (unless the application wants to do a
dynamic simulation):
<code><pre>
      // Compute time to travel to a position.
      Time time = velocity.magnitude() / position.magnitude();
</pre></code>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Output Formatting</h2>

<p>
There are times when the application must present a value to the user.
Since the user needs to see the value in a particular units, the units
must be specified by the application.  An ostream formatting template
class is provided for each 3D unit class.  For example, the following 
prints <code>"(1.1, 2.2, 3.3) ft"</code>:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > length(FeetLength(1.1), FeetLength(2.2), FeetLength(3.3));

      cout << Length3DFormat< FeetLength >(length) << endl;
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
For some units which can be printed as combinations of other units,
the format template classes take more than one argument.  For instance, 
if we wanted to print a speed in miles per minute, we would use the following:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Speed > speed(KnotsSpeed(200), KnotsSpeed(-200), KnotsSpeed(2));

      cout << Speed3DFormat< StatuteMilesLength,
                             MinutesTime >(speed) << endl;
</pre></code>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Unit Conversion</h2>

<p>
Hopefully, applications won't need to explicitly convert 
<code>Unit3D</code> vectors between units, but as we saw in the
<a href="../../scalar/src/scalar.html">scalar</a> library, it can
sometimes become necessary.  In these circumstances, you can use
the format template classes, which provide a <code>vector()</code>
operator:
<code><pre>
      const double factor = 1.234;  // N / m

      Unit3D< Length > length(FeetLength(1.1), FeetLength(2.2), FeetLength(3.3));

      Vector3D< double > newtons = Length3DFormat< MetersLength >(length).vector();

      Unit3D< Force > force(NewtonsForce(newtons.x),
                            NewtonsForce(newtons.y),
                            NewtonsForce(newtons.z));
</pre></code>
Note that we <b>could</b> have used
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< NewtonsForce > force(newtons.x,
                                   newtons.y,
                                   newtons.z);
</pre></code>
But this is dangerous because the compiler will not know how to promote
a <code>Unit3D< NewtonsForce ></code> to a <code>Unit3D< Force ></code>,
which may cause problems.  <b>Always use the base unit class for 
<code>Unit3D</code> instantiations.</b>
</p>


<br>
<h2><a href="Direction3D.h">Direction3D</a></h2>

<p>
When talking about a vector, we typically refer to its magnitude and
direction.  Since the magnitude is a scalar value, it already can be
represented.  But the direction requires a new class:
<code>Direction3D</code>.  This is a special kind of vector whose
magnitude is always 1.  Because of this, you can't scale or add
directions.  You can, however, negate and use the product operators.
</p>

<p>
A <code>Direction3D</code> can be constructed by either using the
<code>direction()</code> operator, or by giving vector components.
For example:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > length(FeetLength(1.1), FeetLength(2.2), FeetLength(3.3));

      Direction3D length_d = length.direction();

      Direction3D dir(1, 2, 3);
</pre></code>
The direction vector is always normalized, so you don't have to worry
about making sure the components have a magnitude of 1.  A direction
can be used to construct a unit of measure vector by multiplying
with a magnitude:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > length = FeetLength(10) * Direction3D(1, 2, 3);
</pre></code>
Because a direction can never have a 0 length, an exception will
be thrown if you ever attempt to directly or indirectly create
a direction with a magnitude of 0.
</p>

<p>
There are only 3 basic functions that can be performed on a direction
besides the arithmetic operators: <code>angle</code>,
<code>midpoint</code>, and <code>interpolate</code>.  The angle
function behaves no differently than with the core vector template
classes.  The midpoint and interpolate functions, however, perform a
linear interpolation on a sphere.  This means that the result will
always have a magnitude of 1.
</p>


<br>
<h2><a href="Rotation3D.h">Rotation3D</a></h2>

<p>
When dealing with vectors, an application will frequently need to
rotate a vector about its origin.  In 3D, this is an angle of rotation 
about an arbitrary axis.  There are many ways to represent a 3D rotation: 
Euler angles, cosine matrix, equivalent angle-axis, unit quaterion, etc.
Two methods are computationally useful: unit quaternion and cosine matrix.
These are represented by the two subclasses of <code>Rotation3D</code>:
<code>QuaternionRotation3D</code> and <code>MatrixRotation3D</code>.
Both have their strong-points and weak-points:
<ul>
<li>Both are non-degenerate at the poles.
<li>Both have pretty much constant accuracy over the range
of possible rotations.
<li>Unit quaternions are easier to normalize.
<li>Unit quaternions have fewer computations for combining rotations.
<li>Cosine matrices have fewer computations for transforming vectors.
</ul>
It's up to the application developer to determine which representation
to use.  If your application does a lot of coordinate system manipulation,
then <code>QuaternionRotation3D</code> might be the best choice.  If your
application does a lot of vector transformations, then 
<code>MatrixRotation3D</code> might be best.  You might even use both
and keep them synchronized (this is common in graphics applications).
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the subclass you choose for the implementation, the 
<code>Rotation3D</code> class obeys linear algebra arithmetic, meaning 
that to rotate a vector, you multiply it by a rotation.  For example:
<code><pre>
      Unit3D< Length > length(FeetLength(1.1), FeetLength(2.2), FeetLength(3.3));

      QuaternionRotation3D quaternion(Direction3D(1, 1, 1), DegreesAngle(45));
      MatrixRotation3D     matrix    (Direction3D(1, 1, 1), DegreesAngle(45));

      // These are equivalent:
      Unit3D< Length > rotated = quaternion * length;
      Unit3D< Length > rotated = matrix     * length;
</pre></code>
The result in this case will be a length vector rotated by 45 degrees
counter-clockwise about the axis (1, 1, 1).  Combining successive 
rotations can be done by multiplication or using the <code>rotate</code> 
convenience function:
<code><pre>
      MatrixRotation3D a(Direction3D(1,  1, 1), DegreesAngle(20));
      MatrixRotation3D b(Direction3D(1, -2, 3), DegreesAngle(30));

      // These are equivalent:
      MatrixRotation3D c = a * b;
      MatrixRotation3D c = a.rotate(DegreesAngle(30));
</pre></code>
Note that rotation multiplication can only be done at the subclass level.
This is because the abstract <code>Rotation3D</code> class doesn't know
which type to instantiate.  However, the <code>rotate</code> is virtual,
meaning you <b>can</b> use it with an abstract <code>Rotation3D</code>.
</p>

<p>
The inverse of a rotation is such that 
<code>(rotation * rotation.inverse())</code> always yields the identity 
rotation (a rotation of 0 angle).  In other words, if rotating <code>a</code>
gives <code>b</code>, then rotating <code>b</code> by the inverse will
give back <code>a</code>.  Note that as with multiplication, 
<code>inverse()</code> can only be done at the subclass level.
Because <code>invert()</code> is virtual, it can be used with an abstract 
<code>Rotation3D</code>.
</p>


<br>
<h2><a href="AngularSpeed3D.h">Unit3D< AngularSpeed ></a></h2>

<p>
A <code>Unit3D< AngularSpeed ></code> requires special mention so as to avoid
confusion.  This represents a 3-dimensional measure of angular speed, which
is probably only useful for representing a rotation vector (used in
dynamic simulations).
Adding a RotationRate class would exceed the scope of this library,
which is to strictly represent units of measure with no interpretation
imposed on them.  But this class is still needs to be provided in
addition to an application-defined RotationRate class because it needs special
visibility to compute things like the magnitude.
A 2-dimensional measure of AngularSpeed doesn't make any sense, so
this is the only vector class with AngularSpeed.
</p>
