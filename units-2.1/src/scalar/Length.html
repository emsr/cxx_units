<title>Class ConOps For Length</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Length Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a length.  The internal representation of
the units is hidden from the user.  Functions include comparison, arithmetic, 
operators.  Functions provided to read and
write an length object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.  A set of
common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Length is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>When a value is assigned to a Length object, the value is converted into 
the internal representation units.  When a value is requested from an object, 
it is converted into the requested units.
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined for convenience are FeetLength, MetersLength,
KilometersLength, NauticalMilesLength, and StatuteMilesLength.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Length can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a subclass to Length.
When an object of a Length class is declared and is given a value, that
value must be specified in terms of some pre-defined subclass.  This is the
only way that the Length class can know how the number provided should be
interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a Length object to a double.  This also
requires a subclass specification so the caller can be assured of getting the
result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Length".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Length length;

      length = route.distance ();

      if ((MetersLength&)length > route.maxRouteLengthMeters())
      {
        // notify user of violated constraint
      }
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
