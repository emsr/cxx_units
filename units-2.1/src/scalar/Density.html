<title>Class ConOps For Density</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Density Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of density.  The internal representation 
of the units is hidden from the user.  Functions include comparison, 
arithmetic, and interaction operators.  Methods provided when necessary to 
interact with related classes.  Functions provided to read and
write a density object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test 
is provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Density is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Density can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a Mass subclass and
a Volume subclass.  When an object of a Density class is declared and is 
given a value, that value must also be specified in terms of a Mass subclass
and a Volume subclass.  This is the only way that the Density class can know 
how the number provided should be interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a Density object to a double.  This also
requires subclass specifications so the caller can be assured of getting the
result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Density".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Density density;
      Volume  tankCapacity = USGallonsVolume(200);
      Mass    fuelWeight;

      density = gasoline.density();

      fuelWeight = tankCapacity * density;

      cout &lt&lt "weight = " &lt&lt fuelWeight &lt&lt endl;

</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with the Mass class, the
Volume class, and doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Mass.html">Mass</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Mass is used in Density operators.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Volume.html">Volume</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Volume is used in Density operators.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
