<title>Class ConOps For Mass</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Mass Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a mass.  The internal representation of
the units is hidden from the user.  Functions include comparison, arithmetic,
and interaction operators.  Methods provided when necessary to interact with
related classes.  Functions provided to read and
write an mass object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.  A set of
common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Mass is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>When a value is assigned to a Mass object, the value is converted into 
the internal representation units.  When a value is requested from an object, 
it is converted into the requested units.
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined for convenience are KilogramsMass and PoundsMass.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Mass can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a subclass to Mass.
When an object of a Mass class is declared and is given a value, that
value must be specified in terms of some pre-defined subclass.  This is the
only way that the Mass class can know how the number provided should be
interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a Mass object to a double.  This also
requires a subclass specification so the caller can be assured of getting the
result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Mass".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Fuel fuelUsed = ???;

      Mass vehicleWeight = route.currentWeight();

      vehicleWeight -= fuelUsed.mass;
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
