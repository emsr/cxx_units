<title>Class ConOps For MassFlowRate</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>MassFlowRate Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a speed.  Functions include comparison,
arithmetic, and interaction operators.  Methods provided when necessary to 
interact with related classes.  Functions provided to read and
write an MassFlowRate object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.
A set of common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>MassFlowRate is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined for convenience are PoundsPerHourMassFlowRate and
KilogramsPerHourMassFlowRate.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of MassFlowRate can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a Length subclass and
a Time subclass.  When an object of a MassFlowRate class is declared and is given a 
value, that value must also be specified in terms of a Length subclass and 
a Time subclass.  This is the only way that the MassFlowRate class can know how the 
value provided should be interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a MassFlowRate object to a double.  This 
requires a Length subclass and a Time subclass specification so the caller 
can be assured of getting the result in an expected way that is not dependent 
on the internal representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest MassFlowRate".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed
it's self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      MassFlowRate speed;

      speed = route.legMassFlowRate (pt1, pt2);

      if ((double)MassFlowRateFormat<MetersLength,SecondsTime>(speed) > 
          vehicle.maxSpeedMetersPerSecond())
      {
        // notify user of violated constraint
      }
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with the Time class, the
Length class, and doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Mass.html">Mass</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Mass is used in MassFlowRate operators.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Time.html">Time</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Time is used in MassFlowRate operators.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
