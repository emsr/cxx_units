<title>Class ConOps For Pressure</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Pressure Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of pressure.  The internal representation 
of the units is hidden from the user.  Functions include comparison and 
arithmetic operators.  Functions provided to read and
write an Pressure object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.  A set 
of common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Pressure is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>When a value is assigned to a Pressure object, the value is converted into 
the internal representation units.  When a value is requested from an object, 
it is converted into the requested units.
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined for convenience are AtmospheresPressure,
InchesHgPressure, and PsiPressure.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Pressure can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a subclass to Pressure
or as a <a href="./Force.html">Force</a> devided by an
<a href="./Area.html">Area</a>.
When an object of a Pressure class is declared and is given a value, that
value must be specified in terms of some pre-defined subclass.  This is the
only way that the Pressure class can know how the number provided should be
interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a Pressure object to a double.  This also
requires a subclass specification so the caller can be assured of getting the
result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Pressure".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Pressure pressure;

      pressure = route.pntAirPressure();

      if (!((MetersPressure&)pressure = Earth.standardPressure))
      {
        // notify user of violated constraint
      }
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Force.html">Force</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Force is used in Pressure operators.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Area.html">Area</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Area is used in Pressure operators.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
