<title>Class ConOps For Area</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Area Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a area.  The internal representation of
the units is hidden from the user.  Functions include comparison, arithmetic,
and interaction operators.  Methods provided when necessary to interact with
related classes.  Functions provided to read and
write an area object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.  A set of
common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Area is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>When a value is assigned to a Area object, the value is converted into 
the internal representation units.  When a value is requested from an object, 
it is converted into the requested units.
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined for convenience are MetersArea, KilometersArea,
NauticalMilesArea, StatuteMilesArea, and AcresArea.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Area can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a subclass to Length.
When an object of a Area class is declared and is given a value, that
value must be specified in terms of some pre-defined Length subclass.  This 
is the only way that the Area class can know how the numbers provided should 
be interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a Area object to a double.  This also
requires a Length subclass specification so the caller can be assured of 
getting the result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Area".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Length nsDistance = NauticalMilesLength(5.0);
      Length ewDistance = NauticalMilesLength(2.0);

      Area threatArea = nsDistance*ewDistance;

      if (((double)AreaFormat<NauticalMilesLength>(threatArea) >
           MIN_AREA) &&
          ((double)AreaFormat<NauticalMilesLength>(threatArea) <=
          MEDIUM_AREA)
         )
      {
        threatSearchFidelity = medium;
      }
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with the Area class
and doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Length.html">Length</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Lengths are combined to produce an Area.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
