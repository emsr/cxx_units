<title>Class ConOps For SignedAngle</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>SignedAngle Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a signed circular angle (values
wrap around).  The internal 
representation of the units is inherited from the Angle class.  Most functions 
are inherited from the Angle class.  Functions to construct, convert to a
double, and the stream operator are overwritten so that the angle can be
normalized if needed.  A function providing a self-test is provided.
A set of common subclasses are provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>SignedAngle is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<p>When a value is assigned to a SignedAngle object, the value is converted 
into the internal representation units as defined by the Angle class.  When a 
value is requested from an object, it is converted into the requested units.
</p>

<p>When a SignedAngle object is converted to a double, the value is
normalized to be between 0 and 360 degrees or between 0 and 2pi radians,
depending on the subclass specified.
</p>

<p>
A circular angle wraps around; that means
DegreesAngle(370) == DegreesAngle(10).
</p>

<p>Subclasses defined are SignedDegreesAngle and SignedRadiansAngle.
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of SignedAngle can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a subclass to 
SignedAngle.  When an object of a SignedAngle class is declared and is 
given a value, that value must be specified in terms of some pre-defined 
subclass.  This is the only way that the SignedAngle class can know how the 
number provided should be interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a SignedAngle object to a double.  
This also requires a subclass specification so the caller can be assured of 
getting the result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest SignedAngle".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed
it's self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      SignedAngle angle;

      angle = vehicle.bankAngle();

      cout &lt&lt "bank angle = " &lt&lt (double)(SignedDegreesAngle &)angle &lt&lt endl;
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of 
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with doubles.
</p>
 
<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="./Angle.html">Angle</a>
    <ul>
    <li>SignedAngle inherits from Angle.
   </ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
