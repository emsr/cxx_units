<h1>User Guide for <a href="../units.html">units</a>::scalar Class Library</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
A scalar is a one-dimensional real number that represents a single
measured value, such as length, time, or mass.  No reference is
assumed for the measured value, and a negative measured value is just
as valid as a positive one.  The application determines the context of
the measurement and the validity of it.
</p>

<p>
Typically, software is written with implicit units for measurements.
That is, a double or float variable is declared and assigned a number
which is implied to be in a particular unit of measure.  For example:
<code><pre>
      double length = 5;  // meters
</pre></code>

This practice can be very dangerous because unit mismatches cannot be
detected at compile time.  For instance, if a function is declared to
take a length in feet, we could accidentally pass it meters and not
be aware of the error until run-time.  Even worse, we could just as
easily pass a completely different unit of measure.  For instance, we
could pass 10 seconds to a function expecting a length in meters.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea of the scalar class library is to abstract the idea of a unit
of measure so that C++ code can be written without the pitfalls of
implicit units.  By declaring base classes for all the common types of
measure and subclasses for common units for each of these types, we can
use the compiler to detect unit mismatches.  The strong type checking
of C++ makes it much more difficult (but not impossible) to accidentally
mix units.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>
Great effort was taken to minimize the overhead associated with using
the scalar classes.  Since operating on measured values is much more
common than construction and initialization, all scalar classes are
designed to have a fixed internal representation.  This internal
representation is hidden from the application so that it can change
without affecting anything else.  Because of this, a scalar class takes 
up the same memory as a double value.
</p>

<p>
Units must be specified with any value assigned to a measurement variable.
For example,
<code><pre>
      Length length = 5;                 // error
      Length length = MetersLength(5);   // OK
</pre></code>

Default constructors are provided for abstract unit types so that a value
can be assigned later.  The default value is undefined (just as with a
double) because assuming a default would introduce unwarrented overhead.
Example:
<code><pre>
      Length length;

      length = MetersLength(5);
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Once a unit of measure is created, it's identity will prevent it from
being used when a function is expecting different units.  For example:
<code><pre>
      extern void doSomething(Length &length);

      doSomething(SecondsTime(5));    // error
      doSomething(MetersLength(5));   // OK
      doSomething(FeetLength(5));     // OK
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
You should not be concerned about construction overhead associated with
constant values.  For instance:
<code><pre>
      if (angle < DegreesAngle(45))
      {
      }
</pre></code>
Some application programmers might be concerned that the 
<code>DegreesAngle</code>
constructor will incur unwanted conversion overhead every time this test 
is performed.  They will instead attempt to use the internal units 
to avoid the conversion:
<code><pre>
      if (angle < RadiansAngle(0.78539816))
      {
      }
</pre></code>
For one thing, this is a dangerous assumption since the internal 
representation is hidden and could potentially change.  Further, since 
most people don't think in radians, this makes the code difficult
to read and understand.  The first method should be used without
concern because most compilers will optimize constant arithmetic
out so no overhead is incurred at run-time.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Comparison</h2>

<p>
Testing for equality can be done in two ways: binary and similar.
Binary equality is the same as testing <code>double == double</code>.
This is potentially dangerous because it compares the binary images
of the two numbers, not their values.  The slightest variation can
lead to an inequality.  It's up to the application to decide if this
is the desired behavior.
</p>

<p>
More often, the application will wish to test if two measurements are
"close enough" to each other.  This can be done with the 
<code>similar</code> function provided with all unit classes.
Each unit class has a default tolerance for determining how close
two values need to be to be considered similar.  The value of the
default tolerance can be accessed via a const data member.  For example:
<code><pre>
      if (similar(MetersLength(2), MetersLength(3)))
      {
         // This will never be true.
      }

      if (similar(MetersLength(2), MetersLength(2.5), MetersLength(1)))
      {
         // This is true.
      }

      // Test for similarity with much tighter tolerance than default.
      if (similar(a, b, MetersLength::defaultTolerance * 0.1))
      {
      }
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Inequality operators are provided for all base unit types.  You can mix
subclasses of the same base to make things readable.  For example:
<code><pre>
      if (MetersLength(1) > FeetLength(1))
      {
         // This is true.
      }
      if (SecondsTime(1) < HoursTime(1))
      {
         // This is true.
      }
</pre></code>
Inequality operators do not use tolerances.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
Once a unit of measure has been constructed, it can be manipulated in many
ways just like a double variable.  The application developer should look
at the appropriate header file to see the full list of valid operators.
Some examples are:
<code><pre>
      Length a = MetersLength(5);

      Length b = 2 * a / 3.4;

      b += 1.2;

      Length c = (a - b);
</pre></code>
Note that the unit type is preserved in arithmetic.  That means you can mix
different units of the same type:
<code><pre>
      Length a = (MetersLength(5) + FeetLength(2));   // OK
      Length a = (MetersLength(5) + SecondsTime(2));  // error
</pre></code>
Most units will cancel themselves by division.  In other words, the
ratio of two Lengths is a double:
<code><pre>
      Length a = MetersLength(5);
      Length b = MetersLength(5);

      double ratio = a/b;
</pre></code>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Cross-Unit Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
Some unit classes have arithmetic operators defined so that they
can interact with other units.  These interactions are the common
relationships between units:
</p>

<center><table>
<tr><td>Speed        </td><td> = Length </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Acceleration </td><td> = Speed  </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force        </td><td> = Mass   </td><td> * Acceleration</td></tr>
<tr><td>AngularSpeed </td><td> = Angle  </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length       </td><td> = Angle  </td><td> * Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Area         </td><td> = Length </td><td> * Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Volume       </td><td> = Area   </td><td> * Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>Density      </td><td> = Mass   </td><td> / Volume</td></tr>
<tr><td>MassFlowRate </td><td> = Mass   </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frequency    </td><td> = double </td><td> / Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pressure     </td><td> = Force  </td><td> / Area</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
These relationships can be rearranged to suit the application.  For 
instance:
<code><pre>
      // Compute speed.
      Speed speed = MetersLength(5) / SecondsTime(2);

      // Compute distance traveled after a duration.
      Length distance = speed * SecondsTime(10); 

      // Compute time to travel a distance.
      Time time = speed / FeetLength(23);
</pre></code>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Unit Conversion</h2>

<p>
Because the internal representation is fixed, conversion between
units take place in the constructor.  Most applications should then
deal only with the abstract types.  However, there are times when an
application must get a double representing the current value.  For 
instance, if an equation cannot easily be converted to use the
abstract types, the measurement must be converted to the units the
equation was expecting.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Standard Atmosphere model
uses the equation:
<code><pre>
      static const double thermalLapseRate = 0.006506986;  // deg C / meter

      static const Temperature seaLevelTemperature = CelsiusTemperature(15.0);

      Temperature computeTemperature(const Length &mslAltitude)
      {
         return (seaLevelTemperature -
                 thermalLapseRate * mslAltitude);
      }
</pre></code>

This won't compile because you can't subtract a Length from a Temperature.
Since there is no unit class defined for Temperature divided by
Length, the application must specify the units to be used for the
multiplication.  Fortunately, there is a double cast operator defined
for all unit subclasses.  This can be used any time the units are known:
<code><pre>
      double meters = (double)MetersLength(5);
</pre></code>

But what about when you only have an abstract measurement?  That's when
you must convert the measurement into the desired units.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways of converting a unit of measure: using the copy
constructor and typecasting a reference.  For example, the previous
example should have been written like this:
<code><pre>
      Temperature computeTemperature(const Length &mslAltitude)
      {
         return (seaLevelTemperature -
                 CelsiusTemperature(thermalLapseRate *
                                    (double)(MetersLength &)mslAltitude);
      }
</pre></code>

Typecasting can only work if you have a reference to a non-temporary
object.  Trying to typecast the result of a function or operation will
usually fail to compile.  In these cases, you should use the copy
constructor.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Output Formatting</h2>

<p>
There are times when the application must present a value to the user.
Since the user needs to see the value in a particular units, the units
must be specified by the application.  An ostream operator is provided 
for all subclasses which prints the value followed by the units 
abbreviation.  For example, the following prints <code>"2.3 ft"</code>:
<code><pre>
      cout << FeetLength(2.3) << endl;
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
For some unit types, there are additional formats which are not available
as subclasses.  For instance, <code>Speed</code> has several common 
combinations of <code>Length</code> and <code>Time</code> types, but 
certainly not all of them.  In these cases, you can use the format
template classes.  For instance, if we wanted to print a speed in
miles per minute, we would use the following:
<code><pre>
      Speed speed = KnotsSpeed(400);
      cout << SpeedFormat< StatuteMilesLength,
                           MinutesTime >(speed) << endl;
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Note that the following will print slightly different things:
<code><pre>
      Speed speed = KnotsSpeed(400);
      cout << SpeedFormat< NauticalMilesLength,
                           HoursTime >(speed) << endl;

      Speed speed = KnotsSpeed(400);
      cout << (KnotsSpeed &)speed << endl;
</pre></code>

The first will print <code>"400 nm/hr"</code>, while the second will
print <code>"400 kts"</code>.
</p>

<p>
The format template classes also provide a double cast operator which
allows the application to get the value in whatever units are required.
</p>

<h2>Special Types</h2>

<p>
While most of the unit types are fairly straight-forward in usage,
there are a few notable types which warrent special consideration:
Temperature and Angle.
</p>

<h3><a href="Temperature.h">Temperature</a></h3>

<p>
Since temperature unit conversions involve an additive offset (for
instance, Kelvin = Celsius + 273), the following arithmetic operations are
not defined for the abstract class: scaling, negation, and ratio.  Doubling
a Kelvin value gives quite a different temperature than doubling a Celsius
value!  You must specify which units to be operated on and then convert
back to the desired units.  For instance:
<code><pre>
      Temperature a = CelsiusTemperature(23);
      Temperature b = a*2;  // error
      Temperature b = CelsiusTemperature((double)(CelsiusTemperature &)a)*2);
</pre></code>
</p>

<h3><a href="Angle.h">Angle</a></h3>

<p>
Mathematically, there are two types of angles: flat and circular.
A flat angle can have any value and has no concept of wrapping around.
In other words, with a flat angle, 0 != 360 degrees.  This is useful
in representing how far a shaft has rotated, for instance.  The
<code>Angle</code> class is a flat angle and gives unconstrained
representation of a measure of angle.
</p>

<p>
A circular angle is one where values wrap around; 0 == 360 degrees.
There are two popular references for circular angles: one that goes
from -180 to 180 degrees and one that goes from 0 to 360 degrees.
These are the <code><a href="SignedAngle.h">SignedAngle</a></code> and 
<code><a href="UnsignedAngle.h">UnsignedAngle</a></code>
classes, respectively.  Both will wrap when testing for similarity.
For instance:
<code><pre>
      if (similar(SignedDegreesAngle( 179),
                  SignedDegreesAngle(-179), DegreesAngle(3))
      {
         // This is true.
      }
      if (similar(UnsignedDegreesAngle(  1),
                  UnsignedDegreesAngle(359), DegreesAngle(3))
      {
         // This is true.
      }
</pre></code>
Subtracting two circular angles will always return the smallest angle 
between the two angles.  For instance:
<code><pre>
      (SignedDegreesAngle(-170) -
       SignedDegreesAngle( 170)   == DegreesAngle( 20)

      (SignedDegreesAngle( 170) -
       SignedDegreesAngle(-170))  == DegreesAngle(-20)

      (UnsignedDegreesAngle( 10) -
       UnsignedDegreesAngle(350)   == DegreesAngle( 20)

      (UnsignedDegreesAngle(350) -
       UnsignedDegreesAngle( 10)   == DegreesAngle(-20)
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
All angle classes can be used with trig functions.  For instance:
<code><pre>
      cos(DegreesAngle( 90)) ==  0
      sin(DegreesAngle(-90)) == -1
      tan(DegreesAngle( 45)) ==  1
</pre></code>
All angle classes can be multiplied by a <code>Length</code> radius to get
the arc-length:
<code><pre>
      DegreesAngle(90) * MetersLength(1)
</pre></code>
</p>
