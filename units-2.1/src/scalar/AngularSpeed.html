<title>Class ConOps For AngularSpeed</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>AngularSpeed Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of angular speed, which is the rate of
change of an angle.  The internal representation of the units is hidden from 
the user.  Functions include comparison, arithmetic, interaction, and 
trigonometric 
operators.  Methods provided when necessary to interact with related classes.
Functions provided to read and
write an angularspeed object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>AngularSpeed is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of AngularSpeed can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of a Angle subclass and
a Time subclass.  When an object of a AngularSpeed class is declared and is 
given a value, that value must also be specified in terms of a Angle subclass 
and a Time subclass.  This is the only way that the AngularSpeed class can 
know how the value provided should be interpreted.
</p>

<p>A function is provided to convert a AngularSpeed object to a double.  This 
also requires a subclass specification so the caller can be assured of getting 
the result in an expected way that is not dependent on the internal
representation.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest AngularSpeed".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed
it's self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Angle changeHeading (const Angle & currentHeading,
                           const Time  & duration)
      {
        // for example purposes, declare a constant rate of heading change
        AngularSpeed headingChangeRate = DegreesAngle(2.3)/SecondsTime(1.0);

        Angle newHeading = currentHeading + headingChangeRate*duration;

        return newHeading;
      }
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of 
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with the Time class, the 
Angle class, and doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./Unit.html">Unit</a>
    <ul>
    <li>This class inherits from the Unit class.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Time.html">Time</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Time is used in AngularSpeed operators.
   </ul>
<li><a href="./Angle.html">Angle</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Angle is used in AngularSpeed operators.
   </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
