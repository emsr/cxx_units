<title>Class ConOps For Acceleration2D</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Acceleration2D Class</h1>


<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>None.
</p>

<h3>ConOps</h3>

<p>Represent the abstract concept of a 2-dimensional acceleration in cartesian
space.  The internal representation is made up of 2 Acceleration class variables, 
X & Y.  Functions include comparison and arithmetic operators.  A function is
provided to determine the magnitude of a object of Acceleration2D.  Functions are
provided to determine between two Acceleration2D objects a midpoint, interpolate, 
distance, and angle.  Functions provided to read and
write an acceleration object in binary format.  A function providing a self-test is 
provided.
</p>

<p>Interfaces with this class are shown at the Unit Library Service level.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Details</h3>

<p>Acceleration2D is one class in a set of classes providing basic unit objects 
needed for a variety of applications.  
</p>

<h3>Object Scenarios / Test Procedures</h3>

<p>An object of Acceleration2D can be declared without a value.  When a value is
assigned to that object, it must be defined in terms of either a set of 2
Acceleration values or another Acceleration2D object.
</p>

<p>To test this class, simply run the unitsTest.exe program by typing 
"unitsTest Acceleration2D".  The test routine will indicate if the class passed it's
self-test.
</p>

<h4>Example Code Snippet</h4>

<code><pre>
      Acceleration2D accelerationVector = (MetersSecondAcceleration(1),
                                           MetersSecondAcceleration(1));

      Acceleration   acceleration = accelerationVector.magnitude();

      cout &lt&lt "acceleration = " &lt&lt acceleration &lt&lt endl;
</pre></code>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Provide comparison operators, as appropriate, to compare to objects of
this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide arithmetic operators, as appropriate, to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide objects of this class.
</p>
 
<p>Provide operators to interact appropriately with doubles.
</p>

<p>Provide a way to print the value of an object.
</p>

<p>Provide binary read and write functions.
</p>

<h3>System Dependencies</h3>

<p>Required classes include:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><a href="./Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Acceleration is used in Acceleration2D functions.
   </ul>


<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>None.
