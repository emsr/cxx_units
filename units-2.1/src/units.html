<h1>User Guide for units Class Library</h1>

<p>
The units library consists of classes and utilities for representing and
manipulating measurements.  There are three class categories
in the units library:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="scalar/scalar.html">scalar</a>
<li><a href="vector2D/vector2D.html">vector2D</a>
<li><a href="vector3D/vector3D.html">vector3D</a>
</ul>

<p>
These groups represent 1, 2, and 3 dimensional measurements,
respectively.  By providing these classes, it is hoped that
application developers can be relieved of the burden of internal
units representation.  The classes allow the C++ compiler to use
typing information to check for unit mismatch errors instead of
waiting until run-time for the errors to pop up.  This frees
the application developer to focus safely on the problem at 
hand and less on the details of how units are represented.
