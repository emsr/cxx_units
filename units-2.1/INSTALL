# Installation instructions for the units of measure library.
#

On MSVC++ 6.0, open the file msvc/units.dsw and build the DLL 
(Release configuration is recommended).
KNOWN ISSUE: test apps don't build due to bugs in the compiler.
Upgrade to .NET!

NOTE: If you get an internal compiler error building Direction2D.cpp,
you need to install service pack 5 or greater to fix the compiler
bug.

With .NET, open the file msvc/units.sln and build all (either
Debug or Release will work, but only Debug builds the test apps).

On UNIX, cd src and make.  After that, you can optionally make install.
